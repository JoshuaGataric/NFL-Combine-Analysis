# NFL-Combine-Analysis
## This NFL Combine analysis provided a comprehensive statistical comparison of performance metrics across different player positions. By utilizing R packages such as tidyverse, dplyr, car, and rstatix, the project effectively identified and visualized key differences between player positions using scatter plots, boxplots, and pairwise t-tests. The findings underscore the distinct physical profiles required for each position, with specific attributes like speed, strength, and explosiveness varying significantly across different roles on the field. Future work could explore more advanced statistical models or delve into the relationship between Combine performance and long-term success in the NFL, offering a predictive view of how Combine metrics translate to professional performance.
