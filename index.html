        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This NFL Combine analysis provided a comprehensive statistical comparison of performance metrics across different player positions. By utilizing R packages such as tidyverse, dplyr, car, and rstatix, the project effectively identified and visualized key differences between player positions using scatter plots, boxplots, and pairwise t-tests.</p>
        
        <p>The findings underscore the distinct physical profiles required for each position, with specific attributes like speed, strength, and explosiveness varying significantly across different roles on the field.</p>

        <p>Future work could explore more advanced statistical models or delve into the relationship between Combine performance and long-term success in the NFL, offering a predictive view of how Combine metrics translate to professional performance.</p>
